# AudioShelf - Web Audiobook & Podcast Player

A simple, self-hosted web application designed to play audiobooks and podcasts directly in your browser. It aims to provide a clean interface, persistent playback positions, and flexibility in sourcing audio content.

**Status:** Early Development

**(Optional: Add a screenshot placeholder here once you have a basic UI)**
<!-- ![Screenshot](link/to/screenshot.png) -->

## Features

*   **MP3 Playback:** Core functionality to play `.mp3` audio files.
*   **Metadata Integration:** Ability to load and display metadata (title, author, series, etc.) associated with audio files.
*   **Flexible Audio Sourcing:**
    *   Supports loading local MP3 files during development.
    *   Designed to fetch audio lists and metadata from external JSON feeds (e.g., hosted on S3, CDNs, or other static hosting).
*   **Playback Persistence:** Uses Browser Local Storage to:
    *   Remember the last playback position for each audio file.
    *   Keep track of which files have been played or started.
*   **Simple Web Interface:** Built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **GitHub Pages Ready:** Designed to be easily hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Data Format:** JSON for audio feeds and metadata.
*   **Storage:** Browser Local Storage API.
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (or any static web host).

```

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Add Sample Audio:** Place some `.mp3` files into the `audio/` directory (or create it if it doesn't exist).

3.  **Create Sample JSON:**
    *   Create a `data/audio-feed.json` file. See the [Data Structure](#data-structure) section below for an example format. Update the `url` paths in this file to point to your local MP3s (e.g., `audio/example_book/chapter1.mp3`).
    *   (Optional) Create corresponding detailed metadata JSON files if you plan that structure.

4.  **Serve Locally:** Because browsers have security restrictions (`CORS`) when loading local files directly (`file:///`), you need to serve the project files via a local web server.
    *   **Using Python 3:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    *   **Using Node.js (requires `http-server` installed globally: `npm install -g http-server`):**
        ```bash
        http-server -p 8000
        ```
    *   **Using VS Code Live Server:** If you use VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option.

5.  **Access the Player:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server).

## Data Structure (Examples)

### `audio-feed.json` (Primary list of audio)

This file lists the available audio items and can contain basic metadata.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "book1_ch1", // Unique identifier for this audio item
    "title": "Chapter 1: The Beginning",
    "artist": "Author Name", // Or 'narrator'
    "album": "Example Book Title", // Or 'series'
    "url": "audio/example_book/chapter1.mp3", // Path/URL to the MP3 file (local or remote)
    "duration": 1850, // Optional: Duration in seconds
    "metadataUrl": "data/metadata/book1_ch1.json" // Optional: Link to more detailed metadata
  },
  {
    "id": "book1_ch2",
    "title": "Chapter 2: The Journey",
    "artist": "Author Name",
    "album": "Example Book Title",
    "url": "https://your-cdn.com/path/to/chapter2.mp3", // Example remote URL
    "duration": 2100
    // No separate metadataUrl in this example
  }
  // ... more audio items
]
```

### `metadata/{id}.json` (Optional detailed metadata)

If using `metadataUrl`, these files contain richer details.

```json
// data/metadata/book1_ch1.json
{
  "id": "book1_ch1",
  "description": "A detailed description of what happens in Chapter 1.",
  "coverArtUrl": "https://your-cdn.com/path/to/cover.jpg",
  "publicationDate": "2023-01-15",
  "tags": ["fiction", "adventure"]
  // ... any other relevant metadata
}
```

### Local Storage Structure

The application might store playback progress under a key like `audioShelfProgress` in Local Storage. The value would likely be a JSON string representing an object similar to this:

```json
{
  "book1_ch1": {
    "currentTime": 125.5, // Last played position in seconds
    "lastPlayedTimestamp": 1678886400000 // Optional: Unix timestamp (ms) when last played
  },
  "book1_ch2": {
    "currentTime": 0,
    "lastPlayedTimestamp": null
  }
  // ... progress for other items
}
```

## Roadmap / Future Plans

*   [ ] Implement fetching and parsing of remote `audio-feed.json`.
*   [ ] Implement fetching and parsing of detailed `metadataUrl` files.
*   [ ] Develop the core audio player UI controls (play/pause, seek bar, volume).
*   [ ] Implement saving/loading playback position to/from Local Storage.
*   [ ] Display metadata in the UI.
*   [ ] Create a playlist/chapter list view.
*   [ ] Add playback speed control.
*   [ ] Add skip forward/backward buttons.
*   [ ] Improve styling and responsiveness.
*   [ ] Add search/filtering capabilities.
*   [ ] Explore offline support (Service Workers).
*   [ ] Add basic error handling (e.g., for failed network requests or missing files).
